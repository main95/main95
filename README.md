ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @main95 (Alberto), I'm a full-stack dev in a Tech Company with a 5-year experience, I'm based on Milan (Italy).
My tech stack is JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Node and I'm currently delving into it.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source projects because I'm new on this topic.

Reach me on my personal e-mail: albertobollettin37@gmail.com
